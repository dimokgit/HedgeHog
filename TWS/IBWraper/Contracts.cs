   * Contracts can be defined in multiple ways. The TWS/IB Gateway will always perform a query on the available contracts
   * and find which one is the best candidate:
   *  - More than a single candidate will yield an ambiguity error message.
   *  - No suitable candidates will produce a "contract not found" message.
   *  How do I find my contract though?
   *  - Often the quickest way is by looking for it in the TWS and looking at its description there (double click).
   *  - The TWS' symbol corresponds to the API's localSymbol. Keep this in mind when defining Futures or Options.
   *  - The TWS' underlying's symbol can usually be mapped to the API's symbol.
